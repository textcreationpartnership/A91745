            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the whole context from the first to the 18. verse, we have a description of the <hi>great love</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:170415:4"/> of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> which she expressed unto <hi>Christ</hi> after his burial, and of the <hi>great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> was pleased to confer upon her, as a testimony of his high esteem, &amp; gracious acceptance of that her <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Her <hi>Love</hi> unto <hi>Christ</hi> she shews, 1. In her <hi>early seeking</hi> him when it was yet dark. 2. In her hasty <hi>calling</hi> of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> to the Sepulchre. 3. In her <hi>staying</hi> behinde after they were gone away to their own home. They rested sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the evidence of the thing, their <hi>senses</hi> saw he was not there, and their <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> told them it would be in vaine there to seek longer for him. But she followed the <hi>Impetus</hi> of a strong affection,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170415:4"/> did not dispute nor consult with ordinary <hi>Reason,</hi> but where she had last seen him laid, there she hankers and lingers after him. His <hi>Honour</hi> to her appears in this that he hath more respect to the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> then to the judgment and <hi>Reason</hi> of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John;</hi> they gave over seeking him out of a dictate of <hi>reason;</hi> she conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued seeking him out of the impulsion of <hi>Love,</hi> though against reason. And Christ is much better pleased with the performance of duty out of <hi>Love</hi> then with the neglect of it out of pretence of <hi>Reason,</hi> and therefore as she <hi>first sought</hi> him, so she <hi>first findes</hi> him, and as before she called the Disciples to the Sepulchre,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170415:5"/> so she imployed to call them again, and to acquaint them with her finding of him.</p>
            <p>In the whole context we may consider these two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Her continued <hi>attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> affection and diligence in <hi>seeking</hi> and inquiring after Christ, when his Disciples had given it over.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Her <hi>successe</hi> in so doing, for first she meets with <hi>witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> of her Lords Resurrection, and then with her <hi>Lord</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>For witnesses of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, here are, 1. The <hi>lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen cloathes</hi> which were left in the grave, for who would take away a dead man naked? who would in such a theft as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170415:5"/> this, when there were souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and a watch at the grave purposely to prevent it, trouble themselves to undo cloaths which were strongly fastned with balme and Odors to his Body? who would stay to wrap them up, and put them in order one from another? his <hi>friends</hi> could not for they were watched: his <hi>enemies</hi> would not for they had sealed up the monument. And this might have fomented the opinion of a <hi>resurrection,</hi> which they endeavoured to suppresse.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is a Vision of <hi>Angels</hi> filling the place where Christ had lien, and a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between her and them.</p>
            <p>After these <hi>witnesses Christ</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:170415:6"/> is pleased himself to appeare unto her, and to confer with her. 1. Under a <hi>disguise</hi> and unknowne compassionating her tears, and enquiring after her desires, <hi>verse</hi> 14, 15. 2. <hi>Discovering himself</hi> to her as sometimes <hi>Joseph</hi> did to his brethren, <hi>verse</hi> 16. and presently imploying her in a <hi>Message</hi> to his Disciples, <hi>verse</hi> 17. which she, notwitstanding her geat desire to have stayed with Christ and to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed his presence, doth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately obey, <hi>verse</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>In the words of the Text observe, 1. The <hi>carriage</hi> and behaviour of <hi>Mary,</hi> and therein these three things. 1. Her <hi>Patience</hi> and unwearied at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, <hi>She stood without at
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170415:6"/> the Sepulchre.</hi> 2. Her <hi>Passion,</hi> she stood <hi>weeping.</hi> 3: Her <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, she stooped down and looked into the Sepulchre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Consequent</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, wherein we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, 1. Who they were whom she saw, <hi>Angels.</hi> 2. The description of them, by their <hi>number, two Angels;</hi> by their <hi>habit,</hi> in <hi>white;</hi> by their <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, sitting one at the head, the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lien.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>carriage</hi> and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of <hi>Mary</hi> comes first to be considered her <hi>patience,</hi> her continued, unwearied, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted attendance in seeking Christ, though the case seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to wiser persons then she was <hi>desperate, But Mary stood
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170415:7"/> without at the Spulchre.</hi> There had been set a <hi>watch</hi> of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, of Souldiers to secure the Sepulchre, she might have beene <hi>deterred</hi> from coming thither by them; when she was come and had called <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> they out of the evidence of the matter, and haply for fear of being obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved go away again to their own home: But neither their <hi>example,</hi> nor the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> she had of their persons doth alter her; nor the <hi>feare</hi> of being observed by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, afright her. Nor the dictate of her own <hi>sense,</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the improbability of speeding, doth dishearten her, but when they are gone she stands to it still. There she
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170415:7"/> was sure her Master had been laid, and from that place no <hi>Reason,</hi> no <hi>feare,</hi> no <hi>prejudice,</hi> no <hi>example</hi> could drawe her, but there she <hi>stood still.</hi> Here was great love indeed to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strip and go beyond the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry greatest Apostles. I do not know that <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is by name spoken of so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of any of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, as of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn: Peter</hi> in the next chapter makes three solemn declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his love to Christ, <hi>Thou knowest that I love thee,</hi> chap. 21.15, 16, 17. <hi>Iohn</hi> was not onely the <hi>beloved</hi> Disciple, but the <hi>loving</hi> Disciple, when all forsook Christ at his Crosse, he staid there with him; none of them wrote so much
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170415:8"/> of <hi>Love</hi> as he.<note place="margin">Beatus Joannes Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelista cum Ephesi mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur usque ad ultimam senectutem, &amp; vix inter Discipulorum manus ad ecclesiam deferretur, nec posset in plura vocem ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba contexere, nihil aliud per singulas solebat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre collectas, nisi hoc, filioli diligite alterutrum. <hi>Hieron. in Gal. 6.</hi>
               </note> It is storied of him, that when he was by old age unable to make long Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, he would sit amongst his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and ingemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate over and over the duty of love: Yet there is a woman who even in that grace for which <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous then the rest of the Disciples, doth outstrip them. Though she knew their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Graces, and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity above hers in the Church, yet in matter of <hi>love</hi> and duty to Christ, she is as ambitious to go beyond them, as they were to outrun one another
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170415:8"/> towards the Sepulchre.</p>
            <p>Here then are three ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Characters of a <hi>strong Love</hi> to Christ. 1. It suffers not it self to be <hi>stinted</hi> or <hi>limitted,</hi> no not by the greatest <hi>Examples,</hi> It hath an holy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation and ambition, it knows no bounds, no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. The weakest woman, the meanest Christian, that truely loves Christ, may pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously strive with the greatest Apostle in this point. Though he be learneder, wiser, more eminent, more useful, more able then I, yet I will not be exceeded, if possible, by him or any in my love to Christ. Every Christian may strive to <hi>excell</hi> any one in grace to get first into the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170415:9"/> Kingdome. So our Saviour bids us <hi>strive to enter</hi> in at the strait gate, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24. and the Apostle to <hi>Covet earnestly</hi> the best gifts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.31. to <hi>seek that we may excell,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.12. to <hi>runne</hi> fastest in the race of salvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24. as <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> here strove to out run one another. God loves spiritual emulation to see any of his servants vie with others who shall be most full of love, meeknesse, patience, perseverance in his service. In <hi>Davids</hi> Worthies this made <hi>Shammah</hi> one of the first three, <hi>The people fled from the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stims, and he stood,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.11. he was not dismayed, nor led away by the example of the rest, nor <hi>Mary</hi> here by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170415:9"/> the Examples of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</p>
            <p>This is great <hi>wisdome</hi> and <hi>constancy,</hi> as well as <hi>Love,</hi> when we will not suffer the <hi>Reverence</hi> of persons, the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> or Names of any, though farre beyond us in graces, to mislead us in matter of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Christ, to make us wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or slack in his service; of all <hi>scandal</hi> and temptations this is one of the strongest: <hi>Peters</hi> example is a snare to <hi>Barnabas</hi> himself, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.13.<note place="margin">

It is strange for common Souldiers to stand when their Leaders flie; yet this we see is the nature of <hi>true Love</hi> to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170415:10"/> Christ, <hi>non continetur terminis alienis.</hi> It suffers not any example to stint it; though <hi>Peter</hi> go, and <hi>Iohn</hi> go, <hi>Mary</hi> stays still.

            <p>There is great need of this Ballast and Constancy of our love to Christ in these incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant times, when many mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure duties by persons, by inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, one for <hi>Paul,</hi> another for <hi>Apollo,</hi> one looks for <hi>Christ</hi> in this way to day, and to morrow in another; many with <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> come and then goe, few with <hi>Mary</hi> stand still when they are in the Right.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170415:13"/> things of the Law unto car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and sensitive disquisitions: to say I cannot see Christ here or there, near me in this temptation, in this distresse, my Reason doubts whether he be in this Ordinance, or in that Ministry, therefore I will give over the Assemblies of Saints, the study of Scripture, the waiting upon him where I am sure I have seen him formerly.

            <p>The second thing consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in her behaviour was, her <hi>Passion,</hi> she <hi>stood weeping,</hi> supposing that she had lost him both living and dead; that the grave had lost him as

            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Piety,</hi> she weeps for the misse and losse of Christ, and for the feare of that further scorne and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which the Enemy might do to his dead body. The duties we learn from thence are two.</p>

               </note> they must not receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dishonour from us. The Piety of the children of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> is commended, that they embalmed <hi>Joseph,</hi> and put him in a Coffin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.26. Christ in his dead body was pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the usual honour from those that loved him, of <hi>lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen cloaths and spices,</hi> John 19.40. when <hi>Dorcas</hi> was dead they <hi>washed her,</hi> Acts 9.37. when <hi>Stephen</hi> was dead, <hi>devout men</hi> took care for his <hi>burial,</hi> and made great lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.2. and Christ esteemed it a good work in her that poured out a box of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170415:15"/> ointment on him because it was <hi>against his burying,</hi> Mar. 14.6. Those that honour God he doth honour, not onely in their <hi>souls</hi> with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but his favour and care extendeth to their <hi>Names,</hi> to their <hi>graves,</hi> to their <hi>ashes,</hi> much more should our love extend to the comforting and refreshing of their bowels while they live amongst us, <hi>Philem</hi> 6.7.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The deepest and truest ground of <hi>sorrow</hi> unto any Christian soule that <hi>loves</hi> Christ, is to <hi>misse</hi> him, and lose him, to seek him and not be able to finde him. The <hi>presence</hi> of Christ is that which makes heaven; <hi>then shall we ever be with the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170415:15"/> Lord,</hi> 1 Thes. 4.17, 18. John. 17.24. and this is the Hell of hells; <hi>Depart from me, Mat.</hi> 7.23, 25, 41. and when ever Christ is to seek to a poore soul in his communion, in the comforts of his presence, the light of his countenance, the taste of his promises, the efficacy of his grace, this is the saddest eclipse that the soul of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian can lie under. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when thou hast Christ hold him fast, let him not go, straggle not by wantonnesse, by presumption, by any neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, from him: It will cost thee many teares to recover him again, and when he hath withdrawn himself, never give over suspiring towards him, enquiring after him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170415:16"/> to recover him; an <hi>eclipse</hi> would be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al if the Luminaries should not move, and continue their orderly courses: move on, do not stand still when thou art in <hi>darknesse,</hi> but carry thy heart on with obedience, though without present com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, in the course of duty, and thou shalt in due time recover light and joy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Errour</hi> of her <hi>tears,</hi> all this disquietnesse was a wrong furmize. In the most holy and ardent affections of Gods children, there may be a mixture of errour and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, when they follow their own conceits, and are not guided by the word and will
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170415:16"/> of God; a sad example whereof we have in <hi>Uzzah,</hi> which made <hi>David</hi> stumble as well as the Kine, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.6, 7. It was love in the <hi>Midwives</hi> to the Church, when they preserved the male chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren alive, but there was sin mingled, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.19, 20. It was love in <hi>Joshuah</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> when he would have <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> forbidden to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, but there was <hi>errour</hi> in that love, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.28, 29. It was love in the other Tribes when they gathered against <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Altar which they had built, but there was <hi>errour</hi> in that love, <hi>Josh,</hi> 22. It was love of holinesse made <hi>Timothy</hi> drink water so much,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170415:17"/> but when it impaired his health, there was <hi>error</hi> in that love, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.23.</p>
            <p>Therefore we should learn in our greatest zeal and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of expressing <hi>love</hi> to Christ to see that our rule and grounds be right: That <hi>Gods will,</hi> and not our owne prejudice or errour, be the principles whence our duties arise, that we be careful to have our <hi>zeale</hi> tempered with <hi>knowledge,</hi> and our <hi>love</hi> regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by <hi>Truth,</hi> else we may create much unnecessary sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to our selves by duties which are very pious, when they be misplaced.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We may here further take notice of the goodnesse of Christ, that when the hearts
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170415:17"/> of his servants are right and aime onely at him, he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth by the <hi>errours</hi> and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of their <hi>holy things,</hi> and rewardeth them according to the love and integrity of their hearts in his eye-sight.</p>
            <p>The third thing was her <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,</hi> as she wept she <hi>stooped down, and looked into the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre;</hi> Her sorrowe and love is not lazy, but tries that a second time, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she had done in vaine: She would not trust her own eyes, nor <hi>Peters,</hi> nor <hi>Johns,</hi> but from <hi>weeping</hi> she returns unto <hi>seeking</hi> againe. Hence we learn two things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. True <hi>godly sorrow</hi> for the losse of Christ will beget uncessant <hi>diligence</hi> for finding
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170415:18"/> him again. <hi>Faith</hi> is not right without <hi>Love, Love</hi> is not enough without <hi>Labour, Hope</hi> is not enough without <hi>patience,</hi> 1 Thes. 1.3. teares are not enough, Christ will have our <hi>sweat</hi> as well as our <hi>teares,</hi> our <hi>working</hi> as well as our <hi>weeping. Esau cryed</hi> for the blessing, but did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.38. <hi>Orpah wept</hi> after <hi>Naomi,</hi> but did <hi>not follow</hi> her, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1.14. the young man was <hi>sorrowfull,</hi> but he <hi>went away,</hi> Mark 10.22. <hi>Hannahs</hi> was right weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.10. <hi>weeping and supplication,</hi> Jer. 3.21. <hi>Hosea</hi> 12.3. <hi>Peters</hi> right weeping, he <hi>went out and wept, weeping and returning,</hi> Mat. 26.75. Jerem. 31.8, 9. <hi>Maries</hi> here
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170415:18"/> was right weeping, she <hi>wept and looked; weeping and seeking,</hi> Jer. 50.4. Never let us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme our sorrow godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, till it set us on work; and stirre up in us practical affections, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. A wicked man may weep out of the <hi>feare</hi> of wrath, out of a <hi>pang</hi> of sudden <hi>devotion,</hi> may <hi>hang down his head as a Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rush,</hi> as <hi>Pharaoh, Judas, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau, Ahab,</hi> and others have done: But no man can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>weep</hi> out of <hi>Love,</hi> and sincerely bewaile his want of Christ, who doth not as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly set himself to finde, and to recover him again.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Love</hi> will make a man do those things over and over again, wherein yet he hath
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170415:19"/> found no comfort nor success before: as faith made <hi>Israell</hi> compasse the Walls of <hi>Jeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> seven dayes together, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 6.13, 15. and obedience, the Prophets servants go out six times together, though he saw nothing, 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 18.43, 44. So love makes <hi>Mary</hi> to look and look again, to see what issue God would send. It is a <hi>waiting grace,</hi> it will not give over without a blessing. Hopes beyond experience. So <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.8. <hi>thrice</hi> besought the Lord. So the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> ventured on, and at last she had as much mercy as she would, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.22, 28.</p>
            <p>Let us learne this wisdom to try once and againe, <hi>not
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170415:19"/> to faint,</hi> or give over if we be not answered presently, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6 9. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Hold the beginning stedfast to the end,</hi> Heb. 3.14. Ply duty, though successe follow not. <hi>Sow in the morning, withold not thine hand in the evening,</hi> Eccles. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>.6. <hi>Light is seed,</hi> Psalme 97.11. we must wait as the Husbandman doth for its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.7. So <hi>Ionah, I said I am cast out of thy sight, yet I will look againe toward thine holy Temple,</hi> Chap. 2.4. So <hi>David,</hi> he <hi>remembred God,</hi> even when he was <hi>afraid to do it,</hi> Psal. 77.3. they who thus wait shall not faile to meet with comfort at last.</p>
            <p>Thus we have seen the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and uncessant love of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170415:20"/> this woman to Christ, outvy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the love of those Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, whose love is more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially taken notice of then any other of the Disciples. The Reason of which we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of what we reade, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.9. where it is said, that Jesus, when he was risen, <hi>appeared first to Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mira ita{que} Je suitae Maldonati audacia, qui primùm matri sua apparuisse asserit, non quod Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelistae fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, sed quod fieri decuerit, in Mat. <hi>28.16</hi> ita Christo dictat quid ipsi facien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum fuerit</note>
               <hi>out of whom he had cast seven Devils:</hi> Whereof like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we read, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.2. The more sins any man hath had remitted, of the more devils he hath been possessed, the more admirable power and mercy he hath found in Christ towards his soul, the more will his heart be enlarged in love unto Christ againe; for <hi>we love him because he loved us,</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:170415:20"/> 1 John 4.19. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had sinned more then all the rest of the Apostles, did labour more abundantly then all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. The more ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice we would do unto God, the more sensible we must be of our own wickednesse, and of his mercy. They to whom <hi>much is forgiven</hi> will <hi>love much,</hi> Luke 7.41, 42, 47.</p>
            <p>We now proceed to the second general part observed in the words, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>successe</hi> of this her great love, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied attendance, she finds not the dead body of Christ, more reason had she had to weep, if she had found it; for if death could have held him, it would not have let
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170415:21"/> us go, we should be still in our sinnes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17. The <hi>mercies of David</hi> were not <hi>sure,</hi> if he should not rise from the dead, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.34. but though she found not the Lord, she found more then they did who went away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, they saw onely the <hi>grave cloathes,</hi> but she seeth <hi>two of her Lords servants,</hi> and she may hope the Master is not farre off, when he sends two servants before him as his use was, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.1. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> usually waits on the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance</hi> of duty: <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> look after Christ, and they see the <hi>linnen cloaths</hi> as evidences of his resurrection; more and <hi>more comfort</hi> waits on <hi>perseverance</hi> in duty. <hi>Mary</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:170415:21"/> continues, and she sees two <hi>Angels</hi> as witnesses of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, and she continues still there, and at last is her selfe become an eye and an eare witness that he was risen indeed: the promise is made to patient continuance in wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing. <hi>To them who by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient continuance in well-doing seek for glory, Honour and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, he will render eternal life,</hi> Rom. 2.6, 7. <hi>Let us not be weary of well-doing, in due season we shall reap if we faint not,</hi> Gal. 6.9. <hi>Be stedfast, unmoveable, alwayes abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as you know that your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is not in vaine in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.58. ye have <hi>need of patience, that after ye have
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170415:22"/> done the will of God, ye may receive the promise,</hi> Heb. 10.36. If yee <hi>continue in my word, then are ye my Disciples indeed,</hi> John 8.31. Doubtlesse this good woman was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that sweet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of Christ, and built upon it, <hi>John</hi> 14.21. <hi>He that loveth me, I will love him, and will manifest my self to him.</hi> Christ is much delighted to see his people outstand difficulties, to see his servants not discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with delayes. Of all affections there is none more patient of <hi>Labour,</hi> and withal none lesse patient of <hi>delay</hi> then <hi>love</hi> is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.12. we do not creep, but runne to the thing we love, because we love not to be long without
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170415:22"/> it. As the Eagle hasteneth to the prey, <hi>Job</hi> 9.26. So doth the poore soule hasten to Christ: As soone as ever <hi>Mary</hi> heard that Christ was come, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.31. She rose up hastily to go unto him; the prodigal sons necessity did not move so fast as his fathers love, he <hi>came,</hi> his father <hi>ranne,</hi> Luke 15.20. by how much the more impatient love is of delay, by so much the more is God pleased to see his servants wait till he will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest himself.</p>
            <p>Well shee looked not in vaine, she sawe <hi>Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all things in the world one would least have expected to finde an <hi>Angel</hi> in a <hi>grave,</hi> Spirits in the place
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170415:23"/> of bodies, Glory in the place of dishonour, Immortality in the place of corruption; but as the Apostle sayes of <hi>Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality, Heb.</hi> 13.2. So may I say of waiting upon Christ, and constancy in duty, be not weary of it, let not sorrow nor despondency of minde discourage, for some have <hi>met with Angells unawares,</hi> where they least of all looked for them.</p>
            <p>There are two things I would note from hence. <hi>Mary</hi> findes not the thing she looks after, the dead body of Christ (as she supposed it was) But she finds that which was more safe for her to finde, <hi>Angells</hi> to witnesse that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:170415:23"/>
            <p>All sincere and unwearied <hi>seeking</hi> of the Lord, hath a certaine promise that it shall <hi>finde,</hi> though not ever the thing which it seeks, yet that which is much fitter and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for us. God deales with his servants as the Countrey man in the fable did with his sonnes, he bid them digge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rootes of his Vines and there they sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld finde treasure; they did so but found none, yet the next year that opening of the roots did produce a plentiful Vintage, they digge for treasure at the roots, and by that meanes found it on the branches. So God tells us that in <hi>keeping his Commandments there is great reward,</hi> we try, and haply at
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170415:24"/> first feel as much affliction as before. But yet at last we do receive the promises, and are able to say by experience <hi>God is good to Israel, to those that are of an upright heart,</hi> Psal. 73.1. The Lord deals with men in spirituals as with <hi>Saul</hi> in temporals; he sought Cattel and God gave him a Kingdom, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.20. <hi>Mary</hi> sought here a dead comfort, and God sent her a living comfort, <hi>Paul</hi> sought for <hi>ease</hi> from tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and God gave him <hi>grace</hi> to sanctifie it unto him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. This is a sweet comfort unto Gods children, God doth not always answer them in their <hi>will,</hi> but he doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes answer them in their <hi>wants. Maries</hi> will was to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170415:24"/> finde Christ in the grave, her want did require that he should be alive and out of his grave. We knowe not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes what to pray, God knowes alwayes what to give.</p>
            <p>This then is the ground of our comfort, the Lord is <hi>nigh to all that call on him in truth,</hi> Psalme 145.18. Jer. 29.13. he doth ever answer such men either <hi>ad votum,</hi> or <hi>ad profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi> either <hi>ad voluntatem,</hi> or <hi>ad utilitatem;</hi> if not to the minde of the <hi>man</hi> which prays, yet alwayes to the minde of the <hi>Spirit</hi> whereby he prayes. If in sickness I pray for health, and God give patience to beare, and grace to sanctifie his visitation to me: if in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170415:25"/> temptation, for comfort, and he give fear to offend h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

            <p>And it should teach us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to adore the dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and wayes of God towards us, and submit our <hi>Reason</hi> to his <hi>Providence;</hi> If we seek this or that and be crossed in it, to conclude God hath some better thing in store for us. It is against a mans will that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170415:25"/> he misseth his way,<note place="margin">Possidius de vita Aug. cap. <hi>12.</hi>
               </note> yet Saint <hi>Austin</hi> by missing his way once escaped the lying in wait of the <hi>Donatists</hi> who intended to kill him. God crossed his will that he might save his life. Sometimes God can make the breaking of the ship to be the saving of the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.44. that a man may say as <hi>Themistocles</hi> did, <hi>periissem nisi periissem;</hi> as <hi>Jonah</hi> had been drowned, if he had not beene devoured; <hi>Manasseh</hi> in probability had perished if he had not beene afflicted, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We may hence observe, when the soul of a poore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever weeps, and sinks, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170415:26"/> desponds, and is at the brink of a grave, ready to drop in and be swallowed up, there usually at the last as it were <hi>in Acie Novaculae,</hi> it meetes with comfort, and <hi>in monte Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debitur, God is seen in the mount,</hi> when <hi>Isaac</hi> is in the very point of being offered up. <hi>Mary</hi> is here weeping, and sadly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with nothing but a grave, and in the house of darknesse she meetes with light. <hi>David</hi> was even at the graves mouth, and then he received a message of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>Psalm</hi> 6.5, 8, 9. <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> under the sentence of death, and then received news of comfort, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28.10, 11, 20. <hi>Jonah</hi> in a double grave, in the <hi>sea</hi> and in the <hi>Whale,</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:170415:26"/> and then brought to shore, <hi>Jonah</hi> 2.6. <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Babylon</hi> as in a <hi>grave,</hi> and thence deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.11. the earth is never neerer fruitfulnesse then when torne and harrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A man is never neerer pity in Gods eye, then when he is most desperate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate in his own.</p>
            <p>It should teach us amidst our greatest discomforts to trust in God under this relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>as a God that raiseth the dead, that calleth things which are not as if they were,</hi> that can sowe light in a <hi>grave,</hi> and cause those which are <hi>in the dust to awake and sing,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.9. Psal. 97 11. Isa. 26 19. <hi>Moses</hi> had not been sonne to a Princesse, if he had not been
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170415:27"/> cast out on the waters, nor <hi>Josph</hi> the second in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, if he had not been cast into a Prison; God can make afflictions the harbingers of joy, as the sorrow of a woman in travel is the preparation to her comfort, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.21.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In that <hi>Mary</hi> meeteth with <hi>Angels</hi> at Christs <hi>grave,</hi> we might observe how the glorious <hi>Angels</hi> of heaven did Minister unto Christ when he was at <hi>lowest,</hi> at his <hi>Birth,</hi> in his <hi>temptation,</hi> in his <hi>Agony,</hi> in his <hi>grave,</hi> they rolled away the stone, and as it were held back the hangings while their Lord came out of his bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>

            <p n="2">2.

It is ill despising any of the least of Christs <hi>little ones;</hi> though they be little in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet they have great <hi>Angels in the presence of God to take care of them,</hi> Mat. 18.10.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It was no strange sight to see <hi>thieves</hi> at a <hi>Crosse,</hi> but a wonderful sight to see <hi>Angels</hi> in a <hi>Grave:</hi> Certainly we may learne by this, that. Christ by his Resurrection hath made great changes and alterations in the <hi>grave:</hi> It is not now the thing it was before; he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170415:28"/> hath the <hi>Keys of hell and death,</hi> Rev. 1.18. The grave hath two doors, a <hi>fore-door</hi> to let out of the world, and a <hi>trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door</hi> to let down into hell; he hath the <hi>Keys</hi> of both for his servants; he hath <hi>opened the fore-door,</hi> and rolled away the stone to give them a <hi>resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and <hi>shut the trap-doore,</hi> the mouth of the pit, that it shall not swallow them up. So that to the godly it is now become <hi>Domus viventium,</hi> as the Jews were wont to call it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.32. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.25. he bore <hi>our curse</hi> on the <hi>crosse,</hi> and left <hi>his blessing</hi> in the <hi>grave. Blessed are they that die in the Lord, they rest, &amp;c.</hi> Rev. 14.13.</p>
            <p>But before these changes
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170415:29"/> in <hi>this grave,</hi> there must be changes in <hi>another grave</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us first. Wicked men are nothing else but <hi>living Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres;</hi> their conscience a pit for dead works, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. their mouth full of rotten communication, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.29. their throat an <hi>open Sepulchre, Psalme</hi> 5.9. their heart deep and profound, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 64.6. the father calls it <hi>Abyssus hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manae conscientiae.</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> grave must be first changed before that other. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> never saw two <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> in a grave, till her own seven <hi>devils</hi> had been cast out; so long as the heart holds fast <hi>sinne,</hi> death holds fast her <hi>sting,</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:170415:29"/> and the horror and darkness of the grave remaines in it still: None can stoop and look boldly into a grave, but they that love Christ. If e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou wilt have thy death comfortable, thou must have thy life fruitful. Live by faith, labour in love, and thou shalt rest in hope. If thou be a true member of Christ, though but a foot, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and lowest in his bodie, the <hi>Angels</hi> have a <hi>charge over thee</hi> both in life and death, in <hi>thy wayes,</hi> and in thy <hi>grave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now next these <hi>Angells</hi> are described, 1. By their <hi>number,</hi> they are <hi>two</hi> to make up a legal competent num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>witnesses, Deut.</hi> 19.15.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170415:30"/> So they testifie his second coming, <hi>Act</hi> 1.10. the <hi>Jews</hi> got <hi>two false witnesses</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.60, 61. and between <hi>two base male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors</hi> crucified him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.38. Now God to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie his Sonne, provided at his Funeral <hi>two Honourable</hi> persons, <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> John. 19.38, 40. to take off the shame of his Crosse, and here <hi>two blessed Angels</hi> to testifie that the curse of the grave was abolished.</p>
            <p>Hence we learne, that Christ and the truth of his Gospel, how low soever by the persecution of men it may be brought, never did, never shall want a sufficient <hi>number</hi> of Honourable <hi>witnesses</hi> to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170415:30"/> maintaine it. Christ sent the seventy <hi>two by two</hi> before him, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.1. and we read of <hi>two witnesses;</hi> a sufficient number of Professors, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3. and when Satan rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the most malicious <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi> God affordeth the most glorious <hi>confirmation,</hi> Act. 17.12. where there is an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lymas</hi> to resist, there is a <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Sergius</hi> to embrace the Gospel, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.7. when <hi>Saul</hi> persecutes the Gospel, the Honourable <hi>Eunuch</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted unto it, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.37. when there are <hi>four horns</hi> to push the Church there are <hi>foure Carpenters</hi> to fray them away, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.19, 21. when there are <hi>bulls</hi> against it, he makes Kings bring Presents
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170415:31"/> unto it, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 68.29, 30. when <hi>men and Nations</hi> abhor Christ, <hi>Kings and Princes arise and worship him,</hi> Isa. 49.7. God never leaves his Gospel either without <hi>evidence</hi> or without <hi>honour,</hi> we have <hi>Catalogum Testium</hi> in the worst ages, of good men, who by their pens and their blood justified oppressed truth against prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling error, and owned Christ under the tyrāny of Antichrist</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Blessed</hi> therefore is <hi>he who is not offended in Christ,</hi> who doth not stumble at the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of the Crosse, nor feare the malice and opposition of wicked men. The Jewes think <hi>theeves</hi> companions good enough for him on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side of his <hi>Crosse,</hi> and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170415:31"/> God sends blessed <hi>Angels</hi> to be servants unto him at either end of his <hi>grave.</hi> Let us follow Christ in a holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, no matter though the wicked of the world abhor and disdain us. God will always provide <hi>an oyntment</hi> for our <hi>Name,</hi> and make it precious in the eys of the truly honorable; and he will provide an <hi>Angel</hi> for our <hi>graves,</hi> to lay us down there in rest and ease. And it is much more comfortable to carry a <hi>Crosse</hi> in our life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and finde an <hi>Angel</hi> in our <hi>grave,</hi> then to glister in the applause of the evil world, and <hi>to</hi> find our <hi>grave,</hi> just as <hi>Adam</hi> left it to us, without life, or rest, or hope in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By their <hi>Habit,</hi> they were
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170415:32"/>
               <hi>in white,</hi> men use to attend Sepulchres in black and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning habits. <hi>Nigros efferre Maritos;</hi> they called such as were to be buried <hi>nigri;</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> the Poets call it, black death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tombes</hi> were dwellings <hi>for devils</hi> and uncleane spirits, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.2, 3 but now <hi>in Christs Tomb</hi> here are <hi>Angels</hi> of light in <hi>white</hi> garments. Garments of praise, <hi>Esay</hi> 61.3. tokens of joy, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.8.

Hence hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was that they who were anciently baptized, were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in <hi>white garments,</hi> as we
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170415:32"/> read in <hi>Lactantius, Ambrose,</hi> and others. <hi>Candius egredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur nitidis exercitus undis;</hi> to note that they were <hi>Candidati Resurrectionis &amp; aeternitatis.</hi> This is certaine there were no ground of joy, no assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to us of victory against hell and death, but by the <hi>resurrection</hi> of Christ. <hi>Fiducia Christianorum resurrectio mortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks. The Resurrection from the dead is the confidence and comfort of Christians.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By their <hi>posture, one at the head, another at the feet,</hi> sure no circumstance is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in vain in this strange sight. I shall not wander in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to various conjectures, but rest in this, that it seems to be
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170415:33"/> an allusion to the <hi>Cherubims</hi> at <hi>either end of the mercy-seat,</hi> Exod. 37.7, 8, 9. Gazing on this great Mystery, this riddle of <hi>Sampson, out of the eater meat, out of the strong sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> out of the grave salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is one great part of the <hi>Mystery of godlinesse, seene of Angels,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12.</p>
            <p>Three Uses we draw from it, and conclude, 1. It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts us, that being in Christ and dying in the Lord, we <hi>sleep</hi> in our graves as it were <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Angels</hi> who have a speciall inspection over us there. 2. is It comfort for the meanest sincere believer in the body of Christ. That Angels do not onely waite
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170415:33"/> upon the <hi>Head,</hi> but upon the <hi>feet.</hi> They do not only <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend,</hi> but <hi>descend on the Sonne of Man,</hi> John 1.51. The top of the ladder reacheth to the glorious head; and the foot to the grave the meanest parts of his members. 3. If I might use an Allegory (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I confesse is fit to be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring) I would note one thing more for our instruction, That we should herein imitate Christ to have an <hi>Angell</hi> not at our <hi>head</hi> onely, but at our <hi>feet</hi> too, many can be content to <hi>have an Angel at their head,</hi> nothing but light there, but they Care not for an <hi>Angel at their feet,</hi> to walk answerably to their Light and Knowledg. <hi>David</hi> caried <hi>his Light</hi> to <hi>his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170415:34"/> feet,</hi> Psal. 119.105. and the charge which God gives his Angels towards us is in order to our <hi>feet and our wayes,</hi> Psalme 91.11. It is a sad thing for a man to have all his Religion in his <hi>Brain</hi> and Tongue, nothing in his <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Conversation.</hi> Devils can transforme themselves into <hi>Angels of Light,</hi> not so easily into <hi>Angels of holinesse.</hi> In some diseases the head swells when the body wastes: It is, though too usual, yet a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous thing to have the <hi>head</hi> onely of a <hi>man,</hi> and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of a <hi>Beast,</hi>

            <p>And now though I have laid on my self a Law of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse and caution in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Funeral Elogies, as no way beneficiall to the <hi>dead,</hi> and sometimes by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident or misapplication hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the <hi>living:</hi> yet give me leave to say this little of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170415:35"/> our dear friend and sister de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. She was both in bodily resemblance, and in moral imitation the transcript of a gracious mother. One in so tender years of as so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne, grave, composed, and even matrone-like a carriage, as did give testimony that her heart was ballassed and poised with serious and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cares.</p>
            <p>She was of a lowly minde, and in special beautified with that grace which the Apostle calleth the <hi>ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of great price.</hi> She lived for the space of an year in my family, with so much sweetnesse and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of conversation, that I
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170415:35"/> believe never any could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in all that time the least appearance of any passion in her.</p>
            <p>She was very watchful over those of her domesticall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which were younger then her selfe, and would with much love and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, instruct, counsel, reprove, and minde them of what she observed to be any way amisse or defective in them, and seriously call upon them to make conscience of their duty to God and men.</p>
            <p>She was exceeding faithful and prudent in discharge of the family trust which was committed unto her. And certainly would have made as good a wife, and true an
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170415:36"/> helper (had the Lord not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed a better condition for her) as most young women that I have had acquaintance with.</p>
            <p>She was a great lover of privacy and retirement, not at all given to <hi>idlenesse</hi> or <hi>tatling,</hi> or <hi>wandring about from house to house,</hi> but very much conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in her closet, reading and praying. It was mixed mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of sorrow &amp; comfort to her in her sicknesse, that when she was well, God enabled her unto some weak performance of duty (the weaknesse whereof she much complained of) to pray earnestly and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for her own soul, and the souls of her relations: and that then when she most desired it
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170415:36"/> she was least able to perform it, the acutenesse of her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease something discompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing her from fixednesse of minde.</p>
            <p>She had very little regard of any thing relating to her health, or recovery in the time of her sicknesse: but her whole thoughts were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with this one care to clear the evidence of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the childe of God.</hi> Those thoughts heaven-ward had the chief possession of her, till the height of her disease disturbed her reason, and then hastened her end: Which I am verily perswaded was unto her an happy dissolution.</p>
            <p>The Lord make us all <hi>wise unto salvation,</hi> and teach
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170415:37"/> us so to <hi>number our dayes, that we may apply our hearts unto that Wisdome;</hi> that <hi>whether we live, we may live unto the Lord, or whether we die, we may die unto the Lord, that unto us to live may be Christ, and to die may be gaine.</hi>
